# TaskTrek

TaskTrek is a comprehensive task management application designed to enhance productivity and efficiency in daily task management. Inspired by effective task management techniques learned during a PAT training session at VIT Bhopal, TaskTrek offers users a structured approach to categorize tasks into four distinct categories:

Urgent & Important
Urgent but Not Important
Not Urgent but Important
Not Urgent & Not Important
By categorizing tasks, users can prioritize their workload effectively and allocate time accordingly. TaskTrek provides the following features to streamline task management:

All Tasks View: Access all available tasks in one convenient location.
Task Addition and Editing: Easily add new tasks or modify existing ones to reflect changing priorities.
Task Filtering: Filter tasks based on their urgency and importance categories for focused attention.
Swipe-to-Remove: Effortlessly remove tasks from the list with a simple swipe gesture.
Tools and Architecture: TaskTrek utilizes RiverPod for state management, sqflite for SQLite database integration, uuid for generating unique task IDs, and implements a Scrollable Positioned List for smooth navigation. The architecture follows a clean code approach, ensuring a well-structured and maintainable codebase.
TaskTrek aims to simplify task management for users, providing a user-friendly interface and robust features to support effective time management and productivity. As an ongoing project, TaskTrek will continue to evolve and improve based on user feedback and iterative development.
